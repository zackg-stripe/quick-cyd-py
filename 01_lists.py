# Part 1 - the seven (or eight) dwarves
#
# a. Replace "None" on line 2 with a list that contains the names of the seven dwarves
# Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Dopey, Bashful, and Doc
dwarves = ["Grumpy", "Happy", "Sleepy", "Sneezy", "Dopey", "Bashful", "Doc"]

# b. Join the crew! Write one line below that adds your name 
#    write a line that prints the new list
dwarves.append("Zack")
print("The eight dwarves: " + str(dwarves))

# c. There are two ways to print out your name from the list using indexes. Do them both
# print(dwarves[7])
# print(dwarves[-3])

# d. Uncomment the line below and print Happy's name using his index in the list
# print(dwarves[1])

# e. Maybe eight is two many, write a line to remove a specific dwarf's name
# (this can be you or another dwarf)
dwarves.remove('Happy')
print(dwarves)

# f. Write one line of code below so that when the list is printed again it is
#    in alphabetical order
dwarves.sort()
print("Seven alphabetical dwarves: " + str(dwarves))

# Part 2 - counting
#
# a. create a variable named one_to_ten that contains the numbers 0 to 100
#    use the range function to do it without typing all the number yourself
one_to_ten = list(range(0, 101))
print(one_to_ten)

# b. use the range function a variable named evens that contains even numbers
#    from 0 to 100 
#    hint: the range function's third parameter will help with this
#    https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp
evens = list(range(0, 101, 2))
print(evens)

# c. use range to create a list that counts *backward* from one to 100
backwards = list(range(100, 0, -1))
print(backwards)


# d. use range to create a list that counts *backward by 5* fromn 100
#    as in 100, 95, 90, 85, 80...
backwards = list(range(100, 0, -5))
print(backwards)
